# What's this about? 
- I'm playing with Zustand state management to minimize requests to mempool for top public Bitcoin pools stat by keeping it in session storage.
Also trying Mantine UI for fun.

# Resources:
  ## DATA: 
  - mempool.space
  ## UI:
  - Mantine v7.8.0
  - tailwind v3.3.0
  - tabler(icons) v3.2.0 
  ## STATE MANAGEMENT:
  - zustand v4.5.2

# Future plan: 
  ## Main:
  - add daily, monthly, yearly stats
  - Add each pool's hashrate
  - Improve UI 
  ## Others:
  - Transaction fee
